          This is a project I created to apply new knowledge that obtained in
          CSS development, being: animation, gradient, variables, fonts and
          position. In addition to other skills such as semantics, file
          structure, generate elements by pure javascript and HTML new tags.

        <p class="zone-description">
          The illuminated zone at the surface of the sea with sufficient light
          for photosynthesis. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs
          here, and marine life is concentrated in this zone, including
          plankton, floating seaweed, jellyfish, tuna, many sharks and dolphins.

        <br />
        <p class="zone-description">
          The most abundant organisms thriving into the mesopelagic zone are
          heterotrophic bacteria. Animals living in this zone include swordfish,
          squid, wolffish and some species of cuttlefish. Many organisms living
          here are bioluminescent. Some mesopelagic creatures rise to the
          epipelagic zone at night to feed.

        <h4>1000m</h4>
        <br />
        <p class="zone-description">
          The name stems from Ancient Greek βαθύς 'deep'. The ocean is pitch
          black at this depth apart from occasional bioluminescent organisms,
          such as anglerfish. No plants live here. Most animals survive on
          detritus known as "marine snow" falling from the zones above or, like
          the marine hatchetfish, by preying on other inhabitants of this zone.
          Other examples of this zone's inhabitants are giant squid, smaller
          squid and the grimpoteuthis or "dumbo octopus". The giant squid is
          hunted here by deep-diving sperm whales.

        <h4>4000m</h4>
        <br />
        <p class="zone-description">
          The name is derived from Ancient Greek ἄβυσσος 'bottomless' - a
          holdover from times when the deep ocean was believed to indeed be
          bottomless. Among the very few creatures living in the cold
          temperatures, high pressures and complete darkness here are several
          species of squid; echinoderms including the basket star, swimming
          cucumber, and the sea pig; and marine arthropods including the sea
          spider. Many species at these depths are transparent and eyeless.

        </h3>
        <h4>6000m</h4>
        <br />
        <p class="zone-description">
          The name is derived from the realm of Hades, the Greek underworld.
          This is the deepest part of the ocean at more than 6,000 m (20,000 ft)
          or 6,500 m (21,300 ft), depending on authority. Such depths are
          generally located in trenches.
